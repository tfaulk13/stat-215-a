```{r, echo = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
# Loading necessary package
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
library(foreach)
library(parallel)
library(doParallel)
library(Rcpp)


```




```{r, echo = F}
# Loading in load.R and clean.R files
source('R/load.R')
source('R/clean.R')
source('R/functions.R')


# Loading and cleaning data
ling.binary <- loadRData()

```



Feel free to decide the sections for your self.

The things you need to do are:

## Compare C++ and R versions of the similarity matrix

## Make the plot for part 3

## Discuss how many clusters to choose

## Discuss whether you trust the method or not


Take extra care on your code for this lab. A significant portion of the grade will be on your code!
