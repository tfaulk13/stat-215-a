You don't have to slavishly follow this template. Please use this structure for your report. Your report should be no more than 12 pages, including figures. Do not include *any* code or code output in your report. Indicate your informal collaborators on the assignment, if you had any.


```{r setup, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load in useful packages
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
# load in the loadData() functions
source("R/load.R")
# load in the cleanData() functions
source("R/clean.R")
```

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
# note that the cache = TRUE chunk argument means that the results of this 
# chunk are saved so it doesn't need to be re-run every time you compile the pdf

# load the dates data
dates_orig <- loadDatesData(path = "data/")
# clean the dates data
dates <- cleanDatesData(dates_orig)

# load the redwood sensor data
redwood_all_orig <- loadRedwoodData(path = "data/", source = "all")
redwood_net_orig <- loadRedwoodData(path = "data/", source = "net")
redwood_log_orig <- loadRedwoodData(path = "data/", source = "log")
# clean the redwood sensor data
